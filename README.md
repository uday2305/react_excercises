# react_excercises

This repo contains small programs to get hands on react.

Generally react runs with Node.js as server and WebPack/Browsersify as Packing tools.

But these excercises are without them for the initial learners who aim's to start learning React from Level 0.

For running you can use your general webserver(tomcat,..etc.,)

If you are using tomcat, you can download them to your webapps folder and start working on them.

These examples contains babel & react as min files on the html page itself.

Once you are acustomed to the syntax of react it would be easy to start full pledged coding with Webpack & Node. 

This is my opinion of learning React, if the learner doesn't aware of webpack or node.
